We use [chef-vault](https://github.com/Nordstrom/chef-vault) to manage our secrets within cookbooks.

Here's an example of creating a vault entry with the required attributes using knife:

TODO: Update with valid entries for your cookbook/recipe.

  knife vault create <%= cookbook_name %> db_credentials '{ "username": "foo", "password": "bar" }'
  -S "role:my-awesome-role"
  -A "my_username" --mode client

The -S argument is the standard chef SOLR search for clients (e.g. fqdn:foo.marchex.com). To see which nodes will match
a given string, do a knife search node "<search string>" with the same argument. Each node returned from the search
query will be given access to these attributes. Note: new nodes are not automatically allowed access. So, in the above
example, if the 'my-awesome-role' role is applied to a node after the vault is created, it will not be able to use these
attributes until the vault is updated (which will encrypt the vault in such a way that the new node's private key can
decrypt it). Re-encrypt the vault with the following command:

  knife vault refresh <%= cookbook_name %> db_credentials --mode client
<% end %>
